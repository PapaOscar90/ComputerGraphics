# README file for OpenGL3 submission

## Description
First we added a UI element that toggles rotation of objects. This is handy when viewing a single object and just want it to constantly rotate. A boolean can be added to change it to rotate the scene about a point if the user wants.

We then added multiple object support by storing all object properties in a struct, including position, rotation, speeds, VAO, etc. This allows a loop that iterates over each object and applies translations and rotations individually.

After that, we then added support for mouse and keyboard control, similar to our OpenGL1. WASD moves the camera, and left clicking and dragging rotates the view. It can be further refined, or changed to direct mouse control, depending on whether game style input or modeling controlers are needed.

Our final submission contains a small scene that satisfies the guidelines for the first half: 2 meshes, 2 textures, 2 of each mesh, different bounce heights for animation, different base rotation speeds, and camera controls. We did not implement zoom (not needed).

## Controls
WASD - Movement
LMB + Drag - Camera rotation

## Feedback
It was a good lab, but we had other projects to focus on for this week.
